			<p>The neurons involved in producing any behavior are distributed widely across the brain. Whereas 

How do we make decisions on the basis of sensory information? What neurons in the brain combine signals according to task rules to guide behavior? 

Of the many diverse, highly-interconnected neuronal populations across the brain, which ones are involved in perceiving sensory events and executing plans of action? When, where, and how are decisions made in the brain?
