				<h1 class="page-title">Brain-wide Circuits Underlying Behavior</h1>
			</div>
			<p>The neurons involved in producing any behavior are distributed widely across the brain. Yet, simple questions about the organization of activity across the brain during behavior remain unknown. </p>

				<div class="science-question"><p>How do widely distributed circuits coordinate their activity to generate successful behaviors?</p></div>
				<div class="science-question"><p>Does information flow from the sensory periphery to motor output in a serial stream, or do multiple areas process it cooperatively in unison? </p></div>
				
				<p>To answer these questions, we require methods for simultaneously observing the activity of many individual neurons across the brain at high temporal resolution. Such methods will allow us to form a functional map showing <b>when, where, and how</b> behaviorally relevant information is processed during perception, decision- making, and action execution. This strategy will allow a paradigm shift in neuroscience: we may go from the study of particular brain regions to the study of complete behaviors, across all brain regions that cooperatively give rise to them.</p>
					
				To address this need, my colleagues and I have developed the use of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/neuropixels">“Neuropixels” probes</a>, next-generation electrode arrays that enable recording simultaneously from thousands of sites across many brain regions in behaving mice (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24636">Jun*, Steinmetz*, et al., Nature, 2017</a>). We are combining this recording technology with a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/behavior">sophisticated behavioral paradigm</a> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28877482">Burgess et al, Cell Reports, 2017</a>), enabling us to assess the correlates of visual perception, decision-making, response execution, and rewards in individual neurons from dozens of brain regions. We are furthermore extending this approach by employing <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/widefield">widefield calcium imaging</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/optogenetics">systematic optogenetics</a>. Togehter, these techniques will enable us to answer new questions about the globally coordinated neuronal activity that generates mammalian behavior.

As a consequence of such loops, the flow of information through the brain cannot be predicted a priori. </div>
